# termiverse

I'm creating a game server for hosting text-based online MMO games. It will be inspired by and use the lessons learned from legacy software like LambdaMOO, IRC, and UNIX derivatives. Users will be able to create their own universes within they can construct and explore arbitrarily large virtual test-based worlds using CLI tooling inspired by UNIX. The primary interface will be an SSH-based terminal interface with rich and colorful ANSI/Unicode text.
