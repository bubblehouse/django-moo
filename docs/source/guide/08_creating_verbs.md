# Creating MOO Programs with Python

> MOO stands for "MUD, Object Oriented." MUD, in turn, has been said to stand for many different things, but I tend to think of it as "Multi-User Dungeon" in the spirit of those ancient precursors to MUDs, Adventure and Zork.
>
> MOO, the programming language, is a relatively small and simple object-oriented language designed to be easy to learn for most non-programmers; most complex systems still require some significant programming ability to accomplish, however.
>
> Having given you enough context to allow you to understand exactly what MOO code is doing, I now explain what MOO code looks like and what it means. I begin with the syntax and semantics of expressions, those pieces of code that have values. After that, I cover statements, the next level of structure up from expressions. Next, I discuss the concept of a task, the kind of running process initiated by players entering commands, among other causes. Finally, I list all of the built-in functions available to MOO code and describe what they do.

## Python Implementation

As mentioned above, DjangoMOO uses Python as its in-game programming language. We usually need to start by importing one essential variable:

    from moo.core import api

The `api` object has a couple of attributes that are useful in most verbs:

1. `caller` â€“ the Object that represents the user who called the verb
2. `writer` - the Callable that prints text to the client connection
3. `parser` - the Parser object when run from the command-line, otherwise None
4. `args`, `kwargs` - function arguments when run as a method, otherwise None

### Getting and Setting the Values of Properties

The Django ORM brings in a few changes to how we access properties. We could potentially use the direct ORM method, like in this example:

```python
 qs = api.caller.location.properties.filter(name="description")
 if qs:
     print(qs[0].value)
 else:
     print("No description.")
```

This doesn't honor inheritance, so you'll probably prefer to use `Object.get_property()`:

```python
 description = api.caller.location.get_property('description')
 print(f"The description is: {description}")
```

It's possible to use the direct ORM method to *set* a property. This method can be useful if you want to further modify the property object or its permissions.

```python
 property = api.caller.location.properties.create(name="description", value="A dark room.")
```

But similarly, you should probably just use:

```python
api.caller.location.set_property("description", "A dark room.")
```

The property interface is still kind of in flux; there's probably no reason not to **[support "dot-syntax" for accessing properties](#9)**.

So far these examples haven't required any calls to `obj.save()`; this is only required for changes to the intrinsic object properties like `name`, `unique_name`, `obvious`, and `owner`.

> [**[TODO](https://gitlab.com/bubblehouse/django-moo/-/issues/9)**] The LambdaCore database uses several properties on `#0`, the system object, for various special purposes. For example, the value of `#0.room` is the "generic room" object, `#0.exit` is the "generic exit" object, etc. This allows MOO programs to refer to these useful objects more easily (and more readably) than using their object numbers directly. To make this usage even easier and more readable, the expression
>
> `$name`
>
> (where name obeys the rules for variable names) is an abbreviation for
>
> `#0.name`
>
> Thus, for example, the value `$nothing` mentioned earlier is really `#-1`, the value of `#0.nothing`.
